# 👋 Hello there, devs!
- 🧔‍♂️ This account is a secondary account from [@gabrielgcbs](https://github.com/gabrielgcbs)
- 📦 It keeps mirror versions of some public repositories from [@gabrielgcbs](https://github.com/gabrielgcbs)
- ⚠️ The reason is to deploy these repositories on the web without security issues
  - 👀 e.g. to let streamlit access only my public repos
- ❤️ If you wish to contribute, please go to the original version of the repository and feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request
